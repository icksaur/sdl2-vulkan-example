# Vulkan Example

An example Vulkan application using SDL2.  The goal is to use Vulkan for some OpenGL equivalent concepts:
framebuffers, vertex buffers and attributes, vertex and fragment shaders, uniforms and uniform buffers, images, mipmapping, samplers, shader storage buffers and compute shaders.

The makefile shows how to build spir-v from glsl source files.

This code is based on another Vulkan sample from github, which was a great starting point but did not get a triangle on the screen.  It also uses lessons from [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com).
