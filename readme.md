# Vulkan Example

An example of a Vulkan application using SDL2.  The goal is to use Vulkan for some OpenGL equivalent concepts:
shader storage buffers, framebuffers, vertex buffers and attributes, shaders, uniforms and uniform buffers, images, samplers, and compute shaders.

The makefile shows how to build spir-v from glsl source files.

This doesn't have the compute into shader storage example yet.

## Requirements
